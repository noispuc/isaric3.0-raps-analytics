# 📦 ISARIC HUB South America – Clinical Epidemiology Platform 🧬🌎

This repository is built to facilitate data analysis using Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs), enabling researchers and public health experts to work with clinical data in a reliable and standardized manner. From real-time outbreak surveillance to scientific discovery, RAPs ensure that data workflows are scalable, replicable, and auditable.

## The analytical flow is powered by three core ISARIC tools:
🧠 ARC – A machine-readable library of standardized questions and expert-designed templates for case report forms (CRFs)

🛠️ BRIDGE – Builds customizable CRFs and REDCap databases from ARC standards

📊 VERTEX – Transforms structured REDCap data into visual outputs and analysis-ready formats

## 🔄 What Are RAPs?
Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs) are modular sequences of analytical steps designed to ensure data analysis will be perfomed using easy-to-use tools.
